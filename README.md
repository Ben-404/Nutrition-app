# Nutrition-app

This app uses the Edamam API to provide detailed nutritional data to users, presenting it in table format, or generating a pdf.

Users can search by providing the ingredient/product name and quantity (g). The API will return the data, which will be displayed within the tkinter window. Users can then view a pdf version of this data, which includes a Matplotlib bar chart to make the data more easy to understand
